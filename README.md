### Overview
This is my very first webpage crafted using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Looking back, the design and implementation don't seem too shabby, but there's undoubtedly a lot of room for improvement.

### Operating Environment
Primarily developed using the latest version of Chrome. It's anticipated to function on the majority of contemporary browsers. However, there's a likelihood of layout issues, especially on browsers like Safari, so it's always a good idea to check before diving deep!
